Hi, I'm Ema!

I'm a Security Engineer from the greater Boston area, and I like to talk about lots of things.  I plan on mainly using this blog for:
* Write-ups for tech projects I do
* Random Journal entries
* DJ Mixes/Music posting
* Anything else I feel like really! Maybe a recipe now and then.

Welcome to my blog! you can find more about me at my [HomePage](https://tusk.sh)

EZ.
